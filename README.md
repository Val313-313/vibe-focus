## the annoying problem

you're vibe coding. you tell Claude "build user auth." twenty minutes in you notice bad error handling. "quickly fix that." then some CSS catches your eye. forty-five minutes later: 15 files touched, 4 different concerns, nothing shipped, and your AI agent is hallucinating because it lost track of what you actually wanted.

your AI agent didn't stop you. it did exactly what you asked. every single time.

**that's context collapse.** and it's context switching on steroids.

## the fix

**vibe-focus** is a CLI that sits next to your AI coding agent and tells it: "no. finish what you started."

- **scope it** — define what's in, what's out. out-of-scope? blocked.
- **one task, clear criteria** — no "done" without meeting them.
- **pushback** — try to switch before finishing? the guardian says no.
- **park it** — new idea mid-task? noted. not now.
- **hook it** — plugs into Claude Code. every prompt gets checked.

## what's new

- **team collaboration** — `vibe-focus-team` shares focus state across your team. see who's working on what, sync tasks, and inject coworker context into guard hooks. solo focus, team awareness.
- **focus history** — `vf history` shows a sparkline of your focus score over time. streaks, trends, weekly averages. all in the terminal.
- **multi-tab workers** — `vf start t2 --worker api` runs parallel tasks in separate terminal tabs. each worker tracks independently.
- **extension API** — `import { loadState } from 'vibe-focus'` — build plugins on top of the core. powers `vibe-focus-team`.

## 30 seconds to focus

```bash
npm install -g vibe-focus

cd your-project
vf init
vf scope --purpose "Build a REST API" --in "endpoints" "auth" --out "frontend" "deployment"
vf add "User registration" -c "POST /register" "Email validation" "Password hashing" "Returns JWT"
vf start t1
vf guard --install
```

done. your AI agent now refuses to let you drift.

## how it actually works

### 1. define your scope

```bash
vf scope --purpose "E-commerce checkout" \
         --in "Cart" "Payment" "Order confirmation" \
         --out "Product catalog" "User profiles" "Admin panel"
```

try to sneak in an admin panel task:

```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  FOCUS GUARDIAN - BLOCKED                        │
│                                                  │
│  "Add admin panel" is outside project scope.     │
│                                                  │
│  Project purpose: E-commerce checkout flow       │
│  Override: --force                               │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

### 2. work the task

```bash
vf add "Cart total calculation" -c "Sum line items" "Apply discounts" "Tax calculation"
vf start t1
vf check t1-c1         # done
vf check t1-c2         # done
vf done                # ship it
```

or add criteria interactively:

```bash
vf add "Cart total calculation" -i
# prompts you line by line. empty line = done.
```

### 3. get pushed back

67% done and trying to switch?

```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  FOCUS GUARDIAN - BLOCKED                        │
│                                                  │
│  You're 67% done with "Cart total calculation".  │
│  Only 1 criterion left!                          │
│                                                  │
│  Finish it. You're almost there.                 │
│  Override: --force                               │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

3+ switches in a day? pattern detected:

```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  FOCUS GUARDIAN - BLOCKED                        │
│                                                  │
│  You've switched 3 times today.                  │
│  This is the context collapse pattern that       │
│  vibe-focus exists to prevent.                   │
│                                                  │
│  Pick ONE task and finish it.                    │
│  Override: --yolo                                │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

yes, the override flag is `--yolo`. you earned it.

### 4. claude code integration

the real thing. `vf guard --install` hooks into Claude Code:

- **every prompt** gets checked against your active task
- **off-task requests** get refused and parked as notes
- **focus rules** are injected as system context
- **acceptance criteria** become Claude's definition of done

what Claude sees on every prompt:

```
VIBE FOCUS ACTIVE - STRICT MODE
CURRENT TASK: t1 - Cart total calculation
REMAINING CRITERIA:
  - Tax calculation
ENFORCEMENT: If request does NOT relate to this task → STOP, REMIND, REDIRECT
```

### 5. park ideas, don't lose them

mid-task eureka moment? park it:

```bash
vf note "refactor the auth middleware"
```

come back later:

```bash
vf note --list              # see all parked ideas
vf note --promote n1        # turn it into a real task
```

### 6. session memory

closing your terminal? save where you left off:

```bash
vf context "implemented cart total, tax calc still open, decided to use Stripe Tax API"
```

next session, the guard hook auto-injects this context. no more "where was I?"

### 7. flow mode

tired of Claude asking permission for every file edit?

```bash
vf flow --on          # auto-approve tools until current task is done
vf superflow --on     # auto-approve until ALL tasks are done
```

auto-disables when you `vf done`. guardrails stay on.

### 8. interactive dashboard

```bash
vf dash
```

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑↓` | Navigate tasks / criteria |
| `Enter` | Start task |
| `Tab` | Switch panels |
| `Space` | Check/uncheck criterion |
| `d` | Mark task done |
| `p` | Copy prompt to clipboard |
| `f` | Force switch (override) |
| `q` | Quit |

### 9. focus history

see your focus over time:

```bash
vf history
```

```
Focus History (14 days)
Score: ▁▃▅▇▇█▅▃▅▇██▇█
       M T W T F S S M T W T F S S
Streak: 5 days | Avg: 78 | Best: 95
```

```bash
vf history -n 30    # last 30 days
vf history --json   # export as JSON
```

### 10. multi-tab workers

working on frontend and backend at the same time? separate tabs, separate focus:

```bash
# Terminal 1
vf start t1 --worker ui
# works on t1, tracked as "ui" worker

# Terminal 2
vf start t2 --worker api
# works on t2, tracked as "api" worker
```

each worker has its own task and guardian. no cross-contamination.

### 11. extension API

build on top of vibe-focus:

```typescript
import { loadState, loadScope } from 'vibe-focus';

const state = loadState();            // full project state
const scope = loadScope();            // project scope
const active = state.tasks.find(t => t.status === 'active');
```

powers the `vibe-focus-team` package for shared team workflows. publish your own extensions via npm.

## focus score

daily score. 0-100. no mercy.

| Score | Label | What it means |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 90-100 | Deep Focus | clean execution. minimal switching. |
| 70-89 | Good Focus | mostly on track. occasional detours. |
| 50-69 | Moderate | too much switching. break tasks down. |
| 0-49 | Context Collapse | you need vibe-focus more than anyone. |

**+20** complete a task. **-10** switch. **-5** override guardian. **-15** abandon.

## philosophy

1. **one task at a time.** context switching is the enemy.
2. **define done before you start.** acceptance criteria prevent scope creep.
3. **friction is a feature.** the pushback makes you think.
4. **override is always possible.** `--force` and `--yolo` exist. your call. but the score remembers.
5. **AI agents need boundaries too.** without scope, they'll refactor your entire codebase when you asked for a button.

## works with

- **Claude Code** — native hook integration
- **Any AI agent** — via `vf prompt` and `vf scope --rules`
- **Solo devs** who want to ship, not spiral
- **Teams** preventing scope creep in AI-assisted sessions
- **Your own tools** — Extension API (`lib.ts`) lets you build on top of vibe-focus
